# Assessment 1 (HTML, CSS)

[Please see course website for full spec](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs6080/NOW/assessments/assignments/ass1)

This assignment is due _Friday 27th September, 8pm_.

Please run `./util/setup.sh` in your terminal before you begin. This will set up some checks in relation to the "Git Commit Requirements".

## Your Task - PicToCode

### 1. Task 1 - Static, fixed size page

Build a page that looks identical to [task1/page.png](task1/page.png). The window width you should work with is 2560 x 1838 pixels. You are only allowed to use HTML and CSS for this task. No external libraries are permitted.

Please build your page in [task1/index.html](task1/index.html). You are welcome to create as many CSS files that you need in the `task1` folder for `index.html` to import. When being marked, your tutor will start with `index.html`.

#### Assets

- The asset(s) are provided in `task1/assets` give you the text to put on the page, any images and icons for the page.
- For the heart emoji, you are able to use a reasonable emoji (or image of your choice found online) to display that element.
- The font used on this page should match exactly. The font used is `sans-serif` for the page.

### 2. Task 2 - Static, fixed size page

Build a page that looks identical to [task2/page.png](task2/page.png). The window width you should work with is 975 x 610 pixels. You are only allowed to use HTML and CSS for this task. No external libraries are permitted.

Please build your page in `task2/index.html`. You are welcome to create as many CSS files that you need in the `task2` folder for `index.html` to import. When being marked, your tutor will start with `index.html`.

#### Assets

- The asset(s) are provided in `task2/assets`.
- The font used on this page should match exactly. The font used is `arial` for the page.

### 3. Task 3 - Responsive, static page

Build a responsive page that complies with [task3/page_big.png](task3/page_big.png) and [task3/page_small.png](task3/page_small.png). The big page is 1552 x 917 pixels, and the small page is 291 x 1068 pixels. Your single page (note that you're not using two separate HTML files) should like identical to either of these pages depending on the window sized the browser is at.

Your are expected to have reasonable intermediate states. In other words, if the window size is some combination of widths between 1552 and 291, combined with some combination of heights between 917 and 1068, the page should still reflect the same general structure.

Please build your page in `task3/index.html`. You are welcome to create as many CSS files that you need in the `task3` folder for `index.html` to import. When being marked, your tutor will start with `index.html`.

#### Assets

- The asset(s) are provided in `task3/assets`.
- The font used on this page should match exactly. The font used is `open-sans` for the page.

# Assumptions

- Markers are aware that font rendering can vary between different browsers and operating systems. As long as you have used the correct font specified for the task and made a reasonable effort to match the intended design, we will not penalize minor typography inconsistencies and will show some leniency in this area.
